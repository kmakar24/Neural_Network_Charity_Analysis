# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview 
We are going to help this foundation, Alphabet Soup, predict where to make investments (which organizations to invest in). In order to do this we will use neaural networks to help Beks create a binary classifier, which is capable of predicting weather applicats will be suffessul if our company funds them. 

## Results 

### Data Preprocessing 

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- We are targeting the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column

The  variables that are considered to be features in my model are the rest of the variables. 

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
- EIN
- NAME

## Summary 
The model predicted that the accuracy is 72.62% which is not suffiecent enough. They would have to make the accuracy precentage higher to use this to make decisions.
